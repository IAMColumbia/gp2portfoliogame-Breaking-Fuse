# GameProgramming2 Final

**Game Name:**	*Cable Connector!* (WIP)
	
**Description Short:**	Cable Connector is a singleplayer 2D puzzle game based on PipeMania(1989) that 
					tests the player's ability to connect a given set of Cables from a starting point to an ending point. 

**Description Long:**	Based on PipeMania and the minigame-genre it established, Cable Connector is a singleplayer 2D puzzle game where different shapes of cables must be connected to power the generator. 
			Types of cables include: A Straight Cable (Vertical or Horizontal), A Curved Cable (90 degree angle), and a 4-Way Cross-Cable. 
			With only a few Cables visible at the start of the level, the player must flip over tiles on the grid-based map in order to reveal the Cable they require.
					The player then needs to rotate their piece so that it fits properly with the previous tile's Power Output. 
					The Power Output is the Yellow electricity that runs through all of the cables it can go through. If the Power Output 
					is misdirected/ends up nowhere, the player will fail the level. 
					The player wins the level if cables can be used to get the Power Output flowing from the starting point to the ending point.
