Release Notes version 2 Vertical Slice

[Notes]
This version adds the Evaluator/Solver. This finishes the model and 
makes this ready to bring into a game engine.
The main mechanic that's missing is input, 
but I wanted to wait for that to be in Unity.


[Instructions]
To generate a grid, either enter Nothing or a size value.
This size will be the row size and column size of the grid.
You can either generate a new grid or [Evaluate] the grid as it is.
Evaluating will perform an update to the connections/"flow".
If the StartingTile(Up-Left Tile) and EndingTile(Right-Bottom Tile)
end with a secure connection, the grid is considered "Solved".
You can apply some Preset Tiles by entering 'P' on the default grid.
