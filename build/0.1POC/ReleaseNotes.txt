Release Notes version 1 POC

In this version, it is a simple Console Application designed to
show the generation of a Grid and the Cables within it. 
These Cables are also rotated and shuffled randomly at 
the start of generation.

The Cable objects have nodes that will be used for 
checking for Valid Nodes at Specific Positions.
These depend on the Cable Type and their rotation. 
The original POC objective was to get the Validation of 
Connected-Cables working, but I got caught up on the design 
behind the Rotator Singleton object and how it would 
cooperate with the other components of the game.

Cable Connector will have 6-by-6 grids by default. 
This can be tested by not inputting any size. 
There is always enough Straight Cables and Curved Cables
to allow there to be a Connection from the Top-Left-most Tile
to the Bottom-Right-most Tile of the grid (which is where
the Power Input/Output Points will be in the final version).
