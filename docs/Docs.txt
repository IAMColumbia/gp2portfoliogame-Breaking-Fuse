~~[First Evaluator class thoughts]~~
The Evaluator is a singleton that can be used by any grid to
look for possible connections and if a grid is solved. 

[Relationship to Grid]
ConsoleGrid Has-A ConsoleEvaluator(ViewModel)
ConsoleEvaluator Uses-A Grid(from ConsoleGrid))

[Constructor]
In Constructor, find the Start Node(first element 
in given Grid). Maybe force a Straight Cable?

[Mechanics]
"Evaluate()" - loop through grid on Generation/GameLoopUpdate 
and "ValidateCableTile(tile)"(tile.IsConnected to true). If
multiple paths are available, follow Priority (Right, Bottom, Up, Left)

ConsoleEvaluator VModel will Re-Write the tile(s) with 
ConsoleColor.Green at end of Evaluate() to show proper Connection.
