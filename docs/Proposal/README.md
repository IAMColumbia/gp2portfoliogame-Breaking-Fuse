Based on PipeMania and the minigame-genre it established, 
Cable Connector is a singleplayer 2D puzzle game made in Unity 
where different shapes of cables must be connected to power a 
generator. Types of cables include: A Straight Cable 
(Vertical or Horizontal), A Curved Cable (90 degree angle), 
a Resistor Cable (Slows Down Flow), and an Untouchable, 
Shorted Cable that can blow up. With only a few Cables visible 
at the start of the level, the player must flip over tiles on 
the grid-based map in order to reveal the Cable they require. 
The player then needs to rotate their piece so that it fits properly 
with the previous tile's Power Output. The Power Output is the 
Yellow electricity that runs through all of the cables it can 
go through. If the Power Output is misdirected/ends up nowhere, 
the player will fail the level. The player wins the level if cables 
can be used to get the Power Output flowing from the starting point 
to the ending point.
